# Introduction

Probably you have already needed product, marketing and business professionals to somehow use a programming language to have greater access to code and automate processes or even other things, but because it is not the purview of many it ends up being an impediment and a greater expense of team efforts for solutions that could be simpler.

Thinking about this Croct created the Contextual Query Language (CQL), an english based language designed to abstract from the teams the complexities behind the delivery.

CQL makes it simple because you only have to write in English to get requests, and developers can use it directly in the code without any additional steps.


## Understand the advantage of using CQL

1. Process using CQL is more straightforward and intuitive for people who are not used to code.
2. Request made by the PO himself.

1. Process passed to a developer
2. Following agile methodologies the process would not be in the sprint and could be deprioritized.
3. Priority tasks for the dev and delay in the delivery of a simple request.
